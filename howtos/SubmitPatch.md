Introduction
------------

This HOWTO describes the steps you should take to get your patch (enhancement or bug fix) accepted into BioPerl, from checking out the latest version to creating a diff file and submitting it to Bugzilla.

Step by Step
------------

### Get the latest version from Subversion

You should ensure you are using the latest developer version of BioPerl - this means checking out [bioperl-live] (or the appropriate repository) from Subversion. Here are [instructions on how to do this]. This is important because the change you want to make may have already been made!


mkdir -p ~/src/bioperl
cd ~/src/bioperl `
svn co `[`svn://code.open-bio.org/bioperl/bioperl-live/trunk`](svn://code.open-bio.org/bioperl/bioperl-live/trunk)` bioperl-live`

### Back up the original file

Let's imagine you want to modify something in `Bio::SeqIO::fasta`. First make a backup copy:

 cd ~/src/bioperl/bioperl-live`
 cp Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm.orig`

### Modify the file

Now go ahead and modify `Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm` to make the changes you think will enhance the module or rectify a bug. Make sure you check it for syntax too.

 perl -I. -c Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm`

### Try your script

You need to now check that you fixed the problem. At this point you will probably re-run the original script which brought the bug to your attention in the first place.

 perl -I. /path/to/my_test_script.pl `

### Write a test

Although trivial bug fixes will be accepted as-is, anything which modifies functionality or any major change will require a [test case] for it to be accepted with any confidence. This will mean either adding extra tests to an existing test file (`t/fasta.t` in this example - make sure you back it up to `t/fasta.t.orig`), or you will need to create a new test file. I would recommend naming it `SeqIO-fasta.t` in this case to avoid future clashes. If your test needs data files, place them in `t/data/`.

 cp t/fasta.t t/fasta.t.orig`

### Run the test

You need to make sure the test is successful too.

 perl -w -I. t/fasta.t`

The -w option ensures that all the warnings are reported just like they will be when the perl test harness runs all BioPerl tests.

### Make the patch

You now need to produce a difference file for each modified (or new) file related to the patch. There are two ways you can accomplish this:

-   Use `svn diff` from the base bioperl-live directory. This is the preferred method for multiple file changes (i.e. test files and modules).

For single files or directories:

 svn diff Bio/SeqIO/`
 svn diff Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm`

For everything:

 svn diff `

-   Use the [diff] tool in Unix.

 diff -Bub Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm.orig Bio/SeqIO/fasta.pm > /tmp/fasta.pm.diff`
 diff -Bub t/fasta.t.orig          t/fasta.t          > /tmp/fasta.t.diff`

### Submit the patch

First read about [Bugs] then log into [Redmine](http://redmine.bioperl.org/). Submit a new feature request, and attach `/tmp/fasta.pm.diff` and `/tmp/fasta.t.diff` to your bug submission. Make sure you write a clear and concise description for the feature request.

### The waiting game

Eventually your bug submission will be processed and assimilated into [bioperl-live] (assuming it wasn't rejected). A notification will be sent to you, and to the [bioperl-guts-l mailing list] which most [BioPerl] developers read.

 while true; do echo "Waiting..."; sleep 3600; done`

### Update your local Git repository

Don't forget to regularly update your Git version of [BioPerl]!

 git pull origin master`

Conclusion
----------

It takes a little bit of effort to submit a patch to [BioPerl] but you are rewarded with that warm fuzzy feeling that giving back to your community provides. If the patch showed BioPerl aptitude, there's a good chance that you will be invited to [become a BioPerl developer] via your own [developer account].
